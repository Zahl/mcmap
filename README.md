## MCMap by Zahl
This is a utility to create maps of Minecraft worlds from an isometric perspective. It can be used to create timelapses with a script. See [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-tools/1260548-mcmap-isometric-renders-ssp-smp-minecraft-1-3-1]) for more information.

To install the dependencies,
`sudo apt-get install -y build-essential zlib1g-dev libpng12-dev g++ libc6-dev`
then, `make` to build, and `./mcmap` to run.

Basic usage is `./mcmap /path/to/world`.
For help, run `./mcmap` without arguments.
